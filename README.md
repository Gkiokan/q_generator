This is my first Readme file.

Q_Generator is a little Javascript,
which creates a div container where you'll be able
to paint a muster with your mouse.

As you paint the JS Code will create a bash within
the code, and will use this code to create the an
unique hash with your prefered decryption.

For now there is only a version with md5 out.
Some more function will be added soon.
